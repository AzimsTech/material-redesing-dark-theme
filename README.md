# Material Incognito Dark Theme (md2)

WARNING: THIS UNLISTED VERSION OF MY THEME IS PRERELEASE ONLY AND WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABANDONED. 

Hey there! You've just stumbled across the next major release of my new theme. As part of Google's Material Design 2 phase, Chrome is being updated with a new look and colour scheme. As a result, all my themes are being modified accordingly to fit. This prerelease version of my new theme matches the colour scheme of Chrome's new md2 look. 

The public version of my theme will be updated to this new version when Chrome's new look is rolled out to everybody. At that point, this unlisted version will be removed. If, however, you are still itching to try out this new version, please follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to chrome://flags/#top-chrome-md and set it to Refresh.
2. Install this prerelease version of the theme ([link here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/material-incognito-dark-t/kgifoiclgcbblgimgcahpikmdphcalda)).

Comments are appreciated.
